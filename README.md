Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
Projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

P1: Explore Weather Trends.
I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

P2: Investigate a Dataset.
In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

P3: Analyze A/B Test Results
I explore the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

P4: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I document my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL
